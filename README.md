## Titanic - Kaggle 

The goal of the project is to apply machine learning techniques in order to predict the passengers that survived at the shipwreck of Titanic. The problem can be expressed as a two-class classification problem (survived or not) and the goal is to design a model that achieves high classification accuracy.
This project constitutes a competition on Kaggle (www.kaggle.com/), a platform that hosts predictive modeling and analytics competitions.
