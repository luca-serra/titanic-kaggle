# Titanic - Kaggle 

The goal of the project is to apply machine learning techniques in order to predict the passengers that survived at the shipwreck of Titanic. The problem can be expressed as a two-class classification problem (survived or not) and the goal is to better the classification accuracy trough different models.
This project constitutes a competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a platform that hosts predictive modeling and analytics competitions.

## Requirements
You can install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data
The data necessary can be found in the Data folder or on Kaggle website.

## Usage
 Run the python file `main.py`.
 * This will run cross validation across the training set, and print the accuracy score.
 * Results will be shown for several classifiers : Naive classifier, Linear SVM, Decision Tree with AdaBoost, Gaussian Kernel SVM.
